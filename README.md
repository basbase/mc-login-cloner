#MC Login Cloner

This program will copy your running game folder and change your username in the launch command. This allows you to play using a different username on servers that do not verify identity. This can be useful for LAN play.

How to use:
1. Download the executable for your platform from the releases page.
2. Place the executable in the directory where you want to clone the game to.
3. Start the game normally using the launcher. Keep the game running.
4. Run the MC Login Cloner executable.
5. Enter your desired username.
6. You can now quit the game. Launch the cloned game using the created launch_<username> script.
